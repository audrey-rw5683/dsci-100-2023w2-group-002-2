The dataset focuses on a specific subset of the population - women of Pima Indian heritage who are 21 years or older. It includes several medical predictor variables alongside one target variable, Outcome, indicating the presence or absence of diabetes. Our project aims to leverage the capabilities of artificial intelligence and data analytics to develop a robust model that can predict the onset of diabetes in patients based on the diagnostic measurements provided in the dataset.
